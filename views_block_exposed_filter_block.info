name = "Views Block Exposed Filter Block"
"Provides blocks for Views exposed filters on View blocks."

# This file exists as a workaround for a problem that was inherited by the 7.x: 
# all module files are named views_block_filter_block.xyz, but they live
# inside a views_block_exposed_filter_block folder (but no matching views_block_exposed_filter_block.info and
# views_block_exposed_filter_block.module files).
